# BioAPI

The primary focus of the project is to consolidate as many datastreams as possible from a wide variety of biological
databases. When possible, third-party libraries such as BioPython and Biotite will be used for parsing different file
formats. In the absence of an established parser, custom class-based parsers will be written.
